# Computational Biology 2 lecture notes

Notebooks with notes for the lecture/exercise session for the Computational Biology 2 course.

The topic is analyzing the evolution of a quickly evolving pathogen: influenza A virus, subtype H3N2.

- in [the first notebook](n01_alignment.ipynb) we download data from the NCBI virus database, perform quality control and align the sequences. We then look at the alignment to detect signatures of selection.
- in [the second notebook](n02_tree.ipynb) we build a phylogenetic tree using IQ-TREE, visualize it, learn to manipulate it with biopython and augment it with metadata.
- in [the third notebook](n03_rooting_trees.ipynb) we talk about the problem of rooting trees, and optimizing branch lenght using time information.
